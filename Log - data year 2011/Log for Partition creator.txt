18          *
19          * This program creates data partitions based on sampling year, analysis year,
20          * result unit, sampling country, efsa prod code and param code.
21          * First, a partition based on analysis year, result unit, efsa prod code and param code
22          * is created. Then, the sampling country information is used to create sub partitions.
23          *
24          * Note that general entries of sampling countries are treated separately. In particular,
25          * each record with sampcountry = EU, Non EU, EEA, Non EEA or Unknown are managed differently.
26          * In fact, given a record, we can check if the related sampling country
27          * is a EU/non EU and EEA/Non EEA country in the CAT_COUNTRY hierarchy.
28          * Since duplicates can be reported the first time with a specific country and the
29          * second time with a generic country (e.g. first italy and then EU), we put all the
30          * generic entries where it is reasonable. For example, if a record has as sampcountry EU,
31          * then it will be added to all the partitions with sampcountry which is an EU country. Note
32          * that also the analysis year, res unit, efsa prod code and param code must match for
33          * adding the EU record to a EU partition, in order to have consistence! It is not useful
34          * to add a EU record to a EU partition if the EU partition has different analysis year
35          * for example.
36          *
37          * Unknown sampcountry records are put in each partition that match the
38          * analysis year, res unit, efsa prod code and param code fields.
