19          * Binning of RESVAL based on previously created partitions
20          * Basically for each partition a set of subpartitions
21          * are created based on the RESVALWWMB value of the record. A bin is created
22          * using all the records which are close in term of RESVALWWMB. In particular, the smallest available element
23          * of the partition is used as starting point of the current bin, then all the records which are close to it
24          * are put in the bin. When no records can be put in the bin, another bin is created and the procedure is iterated
25          * using as starting point the smallest available element of the partition which is not yet in a bin.
26          * The partitions are independent, therefore the bins among different partitions are not correlated.
